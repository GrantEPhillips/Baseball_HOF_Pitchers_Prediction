# 2021 University of San Francisco MSDS 699 Final Project
## Baseball Hall of Fame Pitchers Classification
For my final project for the Machine Learning Laboratory class at the University of San Francisco I did a binary machine learning project. The goal was to build a model using the techniques learned in lectures and while doing assignments to predict whether a pitcher who was on the hall of fame ballot was inducted into the hall of fame. This project could give insight into how hall of fame voters have voted historically and what features are most predictive of whether a pitcher will get inducted into the hall of fame.
